p1: 
limit the amount of video processed , seconds 
, live stream per user, mantain credit for each user, 
each minute is 1 credit, wheather live streaming or video upload processing,
 dont allow upload video with more then 10 minutes of video 
 > upload processing perminute should be function of quality, like fast should be very cheap ,
  like 0.5credits per minute, medium 1credit perminute, and balances to be 1.5credit minute, and advanced 2credit perminite 
  all these should be configurable which can be changed by the admin, 
  live stream should be 1 credit perminute. 


admin should have a way to increment credits for each users
  when user signs in , he get 200 credit free (again configurable)
also when credit runs out, that should be handled accross
